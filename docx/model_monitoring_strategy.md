# Strategy for Automating Retraining, Monitoring Performance and Detecting Model Quality Degradation

This document describes a strategy for automating the process of retraining an ML model, monitoring its performance, and detecting quality degradation resulting from data change (drift).

## 1. Automating Retraining

- **Retraining Triggers:**
  - Detecting a change in the characteristics of the input data (data drift).
  - Performance metrics (e.g. ROC-AUC, precision, recall) falling below established thresholds.
  - Regular schedule (e.g. weekly or monthly retraining).
  
- **Retraining Pipeline:**
  - Using ETL tools and task orchestrators such as Apache Airflow to manage the data extraction, transformation, and loading process to prepare the training set.
  - Running retraining tasks on a dedicated staging environment to verify the results of the new model before deployment.

 - **Model Comparison:**
- Automatic comparison of the new model with the currently running model
- Comparison of key metrics (ROC-AUC, F1 Score, precision, recall).
- Implementation of the rollback mechanism - if the new model does not meet expectations, automatic rollback of changes.

## 2. Monitoring Model Performance

- **Metric Collection:**
- Monitoring key model performance indicators such as:
- ROC-AUC, precision, recall, F1 Score.
- Average prediction time and number of incorrect predictions.

- **Dashboard and Alerts:**
- Displaying metrics on a dashboard (e.g. using Grafana).
- Configuring alerts in monitoring systems (e.g. Prometheus) that will notify the team when a drop in model quality is detected.

- **Log Collection:**
- Aggregating system, input and output logs by tools such as ELK Stack to analyze irregularities.

## 3. Drift Detection

- **Data Drift Analysis:**
- Compares live data distributions to reference data (e.g. using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test or PSI metric).

- **Validation Tests:**
- Periodically runs a set of validation tests to determine if there has been a change in the data distribution.

- **Automatic Reporting:**
- Generates drift reports that indicate the need to retrain the model.

## 4. Integration with CI/CD

- **Automatic Retraining and Deploy Pipelines:**
- Integration with CI/CD environments (e.g. GitHub Actions, Jenkins) enabling:
- Automatically triggers a retraining pipeline when a data change is detected or based on a schedule.

- Builds and deploys a new model to production.

- **Rollback Mechanism:**
- Implementation of the rollback strategy in case the new model shows worse results compared to the previous version.

## Python Code Example - Drift Detection

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.stats import ks_2samp

def detect_drift(reference_data, current_data, alpha=0.05):
    """
    The function compares the distribution of the reference data with the current data using the KS test.
    Returns whether drift was detected, the value of the statistic, and the p-value.
    """
    stat, p_value = ks_2samp(reference_data, current_data)
    drift_detected = p_value < alpha
    return drift_detected, stat, p_value

# Sample Reference and Current Data
reference_data = np.random.normal(loc=0.0, scale=1.0, size=1000)
current_data = np.random.normal(loc=0.1, scale=1.1, size=1000)

drift, stat, p_value = detect_drift(reference_data, current_data)
if drift:
    print("Drift detected: p-value =", p_value)
else:
    print("Drift detected: p-value =", p_value)
```

## Summary

Implementing an automation strategy will allow you to:
- Quickly respond to changes in data by monitoring model metrics.
- Automatically trigger retraining and implement an improved model as soon as quality deviations are detected.
- Minimize the risk of model degradation by systematically comparing the new model with the production version and using rollback mechanisms.

Such a strategy ensures stable and safe operation of the system in a dynamically changing production environment.
