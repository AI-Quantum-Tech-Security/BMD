# Behavioral Authentication ML Project Plan

This document outlines the steps to develop a machine learning-based behavioral authentication system.

## 1. Data Generation and Feature Schema Design

This initial phase focuses on creating the dataset and defining the features that will be used for model training.

### 1.1. Design Behavioral Feature Schema

Before generating data, we'll define the structure and types of our behavioral features.

* **Actions:**
    * Define 8–15 behavioral features. Examples include:
        * `avg_tx_amount`: Average transaction amount for a user.
        * `device_change_freq`: Frequency of device changes for a user.
        * `tx_hour`: Hour of the transaction (0-23).
        * `location_change_freq`: Frequency of location changes for a user.
        * `is_new_device`: Boolean flag indicating if the transaction is from a new device.
        * `transaction_count_24h`: Number of transactions in the last 24 hours.
        * `time_since_last_tx`: Time elapsed since the user's previous transaction.
        * `tx_amount_to_balance_ratio`: Ratio of transaction amount to user's account balance.
        * `ip_address_reputation`: (Simulated) reputation score of the IP address.
        * `is_weekend`: Boolean flag for weekend transactions.
        * `transaction_velocity_10min`: Number of transactions in the last 10 minutes.
        * `country_change_flag`: Boolean flag if the transaction origin country is different from the usual.
    * Map data types for each feature (e.g., numeric, categorical, boolean).
    * Define logic for labeling transactions (`fraud`, `legit`, `suspicious`) based on combinations of these features. This will be heuristic-based for synthetic data. For example:
        * **Fraud:** High `tx_amount_to_balance_ratio` + `is_new_device` + high `location_change_freq`.
        * **Suspicious:** High `transaction_velocity_10min` + unusual `tx_hour`.
        * **Legit:** Default if no other flags are triggered.

* **Deliverable:**
    * `feature_schema.json` or `.yaml` file describing each feature with examples and value ranges.
    * Update `Behavioral_Authentication_ML.md` with a schema overview.

### 1.2. Generate Synthetic Behavioral Dataset

We will create a Python script to simulate realistic transaction data based on the defined schema.

* **Tasks:**
    * Implement a Python script (`generate_behavioral_data.py`) that:
        * Simulates realistic financial transactions per user.
        * Embeds behavioral variation (e.g., some users might have stable behavior, others more erratic).
        * Includes a `risk_flag` (label) using the basic heuristics or randomization defined in the schema design phase.
        * Ensures inclusion of time-based behavior (e.g., `tx_hour`, `is_weekend` flag).
* **Deliverable:**
    * `synthetic_behavioral_dataset.csv` (the generated dataset).
    * `generate_behavioral_data.py` (the Python script).

## 2. Model Training and Evaluation

This phase involves training a machine learning model on the generated data and evaluating its performance.

### 2.1. Train Machine Learning Model

We will train a classification model to predict the `risk_flag`.

* **Tasks:**
    * Train using models like RandomForest, XGBoost, or LightGBM.
    * Use `risk_flag` as the target label.
    * Perform necessary data preprocessing (e.g., encoding categorical features, scaling numerical features).
* **Deliverable:**
    * `risk_model.pkl` (the trained model, saved using `pickle` or `joblib`).

### 2.2. Evaluate Model Performance

After training, we'll evaluate the model's effectiveness.

* **Tasks:**
    * Evaluate using the following metrics:
        * ROC-AUC
        * Precision / Recall (for each class: legit, suspicious, fraud)
        * Confusion Matrix
* **Deliverable:**
    * `risk_model_eval.md` (a report detailing the evaluation metrics and findings).

## 3. API Development and Deployment

This phase focuses on building a microservice to expose our trained model as an API.

### 3.1. Build API Microservice

We will create a Python microservice using Flask or FastAPI.

* **Tasks:**
    * Build API with Flask or FastAPI.
    * Add endpoint `/risk-score` that:
        * Accepts transaction features in JSON format.
        * Returns:
            * `risk_score` (float): A probability or numerical score indicating risk.
            * `risk_flag` (e.g., “legit”, “suspicious”, “fraud”): The categorical risk level.
    * Include test inputs for the API.
    * Generate Swagger/OpenAPI documentation for the API.
* **Deliverable:**
    * Running Python microservice (`ml_risk_api/` directory containing all API code).
    * Example `curl` or Postman calls for testing the endpoint.
    * Swagger API documentation (e.g., accessible via `/docs` endpoint if using FastAPI, or a generated `swagger.json`/`openapi.json`).

### 3.2. Add Logging, CORS, and HTTPS Support

This step enhances the API for debugging, security, and integration.

* **Tasks:**
    * **Add logging for inputs/outputs for debugging:** Implement logging within the `ml_risk_api` to capture incoming request payloads and outgoing responses. This is crucial for debugging and monitoring.
    * **Add CORS and HTTPS if needed:**
        * **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing):** Implement CORS headers if the API will be consumed by a web application hosted on a different domain. This prevents browser security restrictions.
        * **HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure):** Implement HTTPS for secure communication. For a production environment, this is essential. For local testing, self-signed certificates can be used, but for deployment, a proper certificate authority (CA) issued certificate is required.
* **Deliverable:**
    * `final_risk_api.py` (the main API script) with logging and HTTPS support implemented.
    * `ML_API_Integration.md` (integration guide including instructions for setting up HTTPS and consuming the API).

## 4. Integration Testing (Java App)

This final step involves testing the deployed API from a client application.

### 4.1. Test from Java App using Synthetic Data

We will simulate an integration scenario using a Java application.

* **Tasks:**
    * Develop a simple Java application (or a test script) that generates synthetic transaction data (similar in format to the data used for training).
    * The Java app will make API calls to the `/risk-score` endpoint of the Python microservice.
    * Verify that the Java app can successfully send data and receive `risk_score` and `risk_flag` responses.

* **Deliverable:** (Implicit within the `ML_API_Integration.md` as demonstration of consumption)
    * Instructions or a simple code snippet in `ML_API_Integration.md` showing how a Java application would interact with the API, including handling of HTTPS and JSON payloads.
